# Toast-Notifications

Overview of the project â€“
The project is a web-based application that generates toast notifications with random fruit names when a button is clicked. The project's primary purpose is likely to demonstrate the use of JavaScript to create dynamic web content and provide an interactive user experience. The project goals include creating a functional web application that generates dynamic content, demonstrating proficiency in JavaScript programming, providing an interactive user experience with toast notifications, and practicing working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to build a web-based project.


The problem with traditional notifications is that they can be disruptive and take up a lot of screen space, especially on mobile devices. This can be frustrating for users who want to continue using the app while still being informed of important events.

Research has shown that the use of toast notifications can be a more effective and less intrusive way to notify users. Toast notifications are small, unobtrusive messages that appear at the bottom of the screen and quickly disappear after a few seconds.

Therefore, the purpose of this project is to create a customizable and easy-to-use toast notification system that can be integrated into various web applications to improve user experience and engagement.

For this project, one distinct and innovative feature is the dynamic color-coding of the toast notifications. Instead of having fixed colors for different types of notifications, the colors are randomly generated for each notification, giving the user a unique and visually appealing experience and the style can also be set by selecting the preferred style from the dropdown menu. Additionally, the use of setTimeout function to remove the notification after a set time adds to the user experience by providing a seamless and unobtrusive way of displaying important information.
