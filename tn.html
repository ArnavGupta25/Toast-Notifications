    <h1>Toast Notifications</h1>
    <p>
      Toast notifications are a type of non-intrusive, temporary message that appears on a user's screen to provide important information or updates. They are widely used in web and mobile applications as a way to deliver notifications without interrupting the user's current activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toast notifications typically appear at the top or bottom of the screen and then fade away after a short period of time. They are designed to be unobtrusive and quickly provide information to the user, without requiring immediate action.
    </p>
    <h2>Key Features of Toast Notifications</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Non-intrusive:</strong> Toast notifications are designed to be lightweight and non-disruptive. They appear briefly on the screen, allowing users to acknowledge the information without interrupting their workflow.</li>
      <li><strong>Temporary:</strong> Toast notifications are transient and automatically disappear after a few seconds. They don't require manual dismissal, but often provide a close button for users to dismiss them immediately if needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Informative:</strong> Toast notifications are used to communicate important information or updates to users. They can display alerts, notifications, system messages, confirmations, or any other relevant content.</li>
      <li><strong>Positioning:</strong> Toast notifications are typically displayed at the top or bottom of the screen to ensure they are noticeable without obstructing the user's view of the main content.</li>
      <li><strong>Styling:</strong> Toast notifications can be customized to match the design and branding of the application. CSS can be used to define the appearance, including background color, text color, animation, and other visual properties.</li>
      <li><strong>Interaction:</strong> Toast notifications are usually designed to be non-interactive by default, but they can include buttons or links to allow users to perform specific actions or navigate to relevant sections of the application.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Implementing Toast Notifications</h2>
    <p>
      Toast notifications can be implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Alternatively, many libraries and frameworks provide pre-built components and functionality for creating toast notifications, simplifying the implementation process.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general approach for implementing toast notifications involves dynamically creating the notification elements in the DOM using JavaScript. CSS is then used to style the notifications and define their position, animation, and other visual aspects.
